# Credit Spreads in the NBFC Sector of India
This repository is dedicated to the analytical study titled "Credit Spreads in the NBFC Sector of India". The project delves into the intricate dynamics of credit risk and credit spreads within India's Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) sector and proposes models and methodologies to assess and predict these spreads.

## Project Overview
The project aims to understand and quantify the credit spreads associated with corporate bonds within the NBFC sector in India, providing insights into risk assessment and pricing of these financial instruments. It discusses various models for credit risk evaluation, comparing actual spreads with theoretical predictions and analyzing factors affecting credit spreads.

## Key Aspects
1. Credit Risk and Credit Spreads: Detailed overview of credit risk and its impact on credit spreads in the debt market.
2. Methodologies: Introduction to structural models, reduced-form models, and intensity-based models for credit risk assessment, focusing on the Black-Scholes and Merton models.
3. Data Analysis: Utilization of balance sheets and market data from selected NBFCs to calculate credit spreads and risk-neutral probabilities of default.
4. Comparative Analysis: Comparison of calculated spreads with actual market spreads and a cross-country analysis to understand the relative positioning of India's NBFC sector.

## Repository Contents
1. Data Sets: Collected data from various NBFCs including balance sheets, market data, and implied volatility figures.
2. Scripts and Notebooks: Code used for the implementation of various credit risk models and spread calculations.
3. Presentation Slides: Slides that outline the project's scope, methodology, findings, and insights.

## Key Findings
1. The study identifies critical factors influencing credit spreads, including probability of default, liquidity risk, economy strength, and inflation.
2. It highlights the differences in credit spreads across various NBFCs based on their financial health and market conditions.
The comparison of calculated spreads with actual market spreads reveals the effectiveness of the models and provides insights into market behavior.

## Limitations and Future Scope
1. The analysis is based on a limited time frame and a selected set of NBFCs. Future studies might include a more extensive dataset and consider a longer period.
2. While the Black-Scholes and Merton models provide a robust framework, they have certain limitations and assumptions which might affect the real-world applicability.
3. Future research might focus on enhancing these models, exploring other factors affecting credit spreads, or applying machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.
